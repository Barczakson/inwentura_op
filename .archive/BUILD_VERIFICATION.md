# Build Verification Script

This script verifies that the build process is working correctly with the PostgreSQL configuration.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- PostgreSQL database accessible (for runtime, not for build)

## Steps to verify the build

1. Clean the environment:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules .next
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the Vercel build:
   ```bash
   npm run vercel-build
   ```

4. Check that the build completes successfully without database connection errors

## Expected Output
- The build should complete without errors
- The Prisma client should be generated with the PostgreSQL schema
- No database connection errors should occur during the build process

## Next Steps
- Deploy to Vercel with the correct PostgreSQL database connection string in environment variables
- Test the application locally with a PostgreSQL database for development if needed
