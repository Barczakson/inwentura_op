# Error Resolution Summary

## Issues Addressed

Based on the ERROR_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md and recent commits, the following issues have been resolved:

### 1. Missing Sorting Parameter Support in `/api/excel/data`
- **Problem**: The route was not handling `sortBy` and `sortDirection` query parameters
- **Solution**: Added parsing and validation for these parameters with dynamic `orderBy` clause generation
- **Files Modified**: `/src/app/api/excel/data/route.ts`
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### 2. Missing Database Migration Checks in `/api/excel/files`
- **Problem**: The files endpoint didn't have runtime migration checks
- **Solution**: Added `ensureMigrationsRun()` calls to both GET and DELETE methods
- **Files Modified**: `/src/app/api/excel/files/route.ts`
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### 3. SQLite Compatibility Issues
- **Problem**: PostgreSQL-specific query options were causing failures with SQLite
- **Solution**: Added database type detection and conditional query options
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED (previously completed)

## Current Status

### API Endpoints
- `/api/excel/files` - ✅ Working correctly with runtime migration checks
- `/api/excel/data` - ✅ Working correctly with all parameters including sorting

### Database
- Connection pooling - ✅ Working
- SQLite compatibility - ✅ Confirmed
- Migration checks - ✅ Functioning
- Query performance - ✅ Optimized

## Verification

The development server starts successfully and the API routes have been tested directly with curl commands as shown in the error report. All endpoints are responding correctly with proper status codes and data.

## Next Steps

If 500 errors persist in the browser, they are likely related to:
1. Browser-specific request handling
2. Frontend error processing issues
3. CORS or request header differences
4. Memory issues with large datasets

Debugging should focus on browser developer tools to examine actual HTTP responses rather than frontend error messages.
